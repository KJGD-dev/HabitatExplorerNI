# HabitatExplorerNI

This was the final product build for my dissertaiton project for my Masters in Software Development at Queens University Belfast. The app is called Habitat Explorer NI. Still a lot of bugs and fixes that need to be corrected, so I intend to keep editing and improving the software over time. My masters course didn't include any mobile app development so this was my first ever attempt at creating a native mobile application for iOS and with that came many challenges.
